.SH NAME
.PP
kubectl expose \- Take a replicated application and expose it as Kubernetes Service


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBkubectl expose\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Take a replicated application and expose it as Kubernetes Service.

.PP
Looks up a replication controller or service by name and uses the selector for that resource as the
selector for a new Service on the specified port. If no labels are specified, the new service will
re\-use the labels from the resource it exposes.


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-\-container\-port\fP=""
    Synonym for \-\-target\-port

.PP
\fB\-\-create\-external\-load\-balancer\fP=false
    If true, create an external load balancer for this service (trumped by \-\-type). Implementation is cloud provider dependent. Default is 'false'.

.PP
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fP=false
    If true, only print the object that would be sent, without creating it.

.PP
\fB\-\-generator\fP="service/v2"
    The name of the API generator to use. There are 2 generators: 'service/v1' and 'service/v2'. The only difference between them is that service port in v1 is named 'default', while it is left unnamed in v2. Default is 'service/v2'.

.PP
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP=false
    help for expose

.PP
\fB\-l\fP, \fB\-\-labels\fP=""

.PP
\fB\-\-port\fP=\-1
    The port that the service should serve on. Copied from the resource being exposed, if unspecified

.PP
\fB\-\-protocol\fP="TCP"
    The network protocol for the service to be created. Default is 'tcp'.

    Name of a public IP address to set for the service. The service will be assigned this IP in addition to its generated service IP.

.PP
\fB\-\-selector\fP=""
    A label selector to use for this service. If empty (the default) infer the selector from the replication controller.

.PP

.PP
\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-template\fP=""

.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
.RS

.nf
// Creates a service for a replicated nginx, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000.
$ kubectl expose rc nginx \-\-port=80 \-\-target\-port=8000

// Creates a second service based on the above service, exposing the container port 8443 as port 443 with the name "nginx\-https"
$ kubectl expose service nginx \-\-port=443 \-\-target\-port=8443 \-\-name=nginx\-https

// Create a service for a replicated streaming application on port 4100 balancing UDP traffic and named 'video\-stream'.
$ kubectl expose rc streamer \-\-port=4100 \-\-protocol=udp \-\-name=video\-stream
